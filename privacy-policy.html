# üîê Privacy Policy ‚Äì Fake News Detection for Reddit

**Effective Date:** July 18, 2025

This browser extension ("the Extension") helps users analyze the credibility of Reddit posts using a custom machine learning model.

## 1. Information Collected

The Extension does **not collect any personal or identifiable user data**.

However, it may process the following **non-personal** data:
- Reddit post content (text only)
- Post metadata (e.g., subreddit name, post ID)

This data is temporarily sent to a secure backend server to generate a fake/real prediction using our custom AI model.

## 2. How We Use This Data

- To provide users with a prediction (Likely Real / Likely Fake)
- To display reasoning for the prediction

We do **not store**, **sell**, or **share** any of this data with third parties.

## 3. Permissions Used

The Extension requires the following Chrome permissions:
- `activeTab` and host access (`https://www.reddit.com/*`) to read post content
- `scripting` to display results in the Reddit UI
- `storage` to store minimal user preferences locally

## 4. Data Retention

No data is permanently stored. All processing happens in real-time, and data is discarded immediately after the prediction is made.

## 5. Contact

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the extension, please contact:
